## Why a structured rollout matters

Crystal ERP has helped hundreds of Kenyan retailers standardize how tills, inventory controls, and finance workflows are launched. A documented plan keeps every branch aligned and protects margins from day one.

### 1. Site survey & hardware plan

- Audit existing tills, printers, barcode scanners, and network drops in each branch.
- Reserve backup power (UPS) for high-volume stores in Nairobi CBD where outages can spike.
- Order Crystal ERP-approved hardware kits and schedule deliveries 48 hours before installation.

### 2. Data & compliance preparation

- Consolidate inventory masters and supplier price lists into a single spreadsheet.
- Map ETIMS and VAT settings per outlet; confirm tax groups and exempt codes.
- Configure payment channels (Mpesa, card, cash) with Crystal ERP reconciliation templates.

### 3. Training & go-live support

- Run role-based sessions: cashiers, supervisors, finance, and IT each get tailored agendas.
- Simulate end-of-day processes, stock adjustments, and Mpesa balancing before launch.
- Keep the Crystal ERP success hotline on WhatsApp handy for the first trading week.
